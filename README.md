# SC1015-Group-2

Make sure the README file is decently written (like a short report) to describe your work.
README does not need to have all minor details, but it should broadly explain your work.
README does not need to be too huge. Keep it simple, compact, but sufficiently detailed.
Make sure the README ends with each individual contribution in the project by members.
Make sure the README ends with each online/offline reference you consulted or utilized.
Don't go over the top please. Try to make the README a 3 to 5 minute read -- not more.
